		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>The New England Valkyries Rugby Football Club is a gay rugby
			club dedicated to creating an open and inclusive environment, based
			on mutual respect, designed to provide intensive basic training for
			adult beginners as well as challenging training for experienced
			ruggers, with the goal of participating in competitive rugby and
			challenging homophobia in sport.</p>

		<h2>Who we are</h2>
		<p>The Valkyries are, first and foremost, a band of rugby
			brothers. Every member of our club is focused on competitive rugby
			before everything else - players, coach and leaders. We work hard in
			training, we leave everything on the pitch and then we play hard. Our
			debut this year at the Combustion Tournament in Chicago put this
			philosophy to the test and we were rewarded with two days of amazing
			rugby and a second place trophy.</p>

		<h2>What we do</h2>
		<p>The Valkyries rugby program is designed to instill a basic core
			of rugby skills and fitness for those who have never played rugby,
			while at the same time maintaining a challenging training program for
			those more experienced with the sport. If you're new to the sport we
			know starting out in rugby can be overwhelming. Our head coach, with
			almost 20 years of rugby playing and coaching experience has designed
			a Rugby 101 program to get you up to speed on all the basics -
			skills, terminology and basic conditioning, before you're integrated
			into regular practice sessions. After graduation from the Rugby 101
			program, new players will be paired with an experienced player who
			will help them get up to speed on regular practice sessions. Our goal
			is to give every player, new and experienced, every tool and resource
			they need to improve their level of rugby with every training
			session.</p>

		<h2>Who can join?</h2>
		<p>The Valkyries are a gay rugby club, but you don't have to be
			gay to be a member. We believe that rugby should be for anyone with
			the passion to embrace the game. Our club welcomes players from all
			races, sexual orientations and skill levels.</p>


		<p>
			If you're looking for a physically and mentally challenging sport, in
			an environment of hard work and mutual respect than the Valkyries is
			the team for you. <a href="../joinus/index.html">Join Us!</a>
