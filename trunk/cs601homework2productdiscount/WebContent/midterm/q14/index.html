	<h1>Answer To Question 14</h1>
	<p>What are the differences between GET and POST methods when an
		HTML 5 form to your server?</p>
	<p>Many differences:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The GET method encodes the form parameters into the URL of
			the call, the POST method encodes the form parameters into the HTTP
			header.</li>
		<li>For that reason, the parameters are visible in the URL on a
			GET, not on a POST.</li>
		<li>With POSTs, the browser will usually alert the user about
			re-posting the data.</li>
		<li>Since GETs are part of the URL, they can be bookmarked,
			including the parameters.</li>
		<li>The GET method has limitations on the URL length. IE has the
			lowest allowed length at 2k or so.</li>
		<li>The back-end has to use different functions to access POST
			and GET data.</li>
	</ol>
