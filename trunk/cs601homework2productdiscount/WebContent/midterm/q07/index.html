	<h1>Answer to Question 7</h1>
	<h2>Descendant Selector Example</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p>This is the paragraph in the first div. It is red because of
				the descendant selector.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>This is a whole 'nother div entirely separate from the top div.
			It is NOT red because this div is not part of the descendant
			selector.</p>
	</div>

	<br>

	<h2>Adjacent Selector Example</h2>
	<div>
		<p>This is the first paragraph in the div. It is NOT green because
			it is not the target of an adjacent selector (it needs to be adjacent
			to a previous paragraph to be a target).</p>
		<p>This is the second paragraph in the div. It is green because it
			is the target of the two paragraph adjacent selector.</p>
		<p>This is the third paragraph in the div. It is green because it
			is the target of the two paragraph adjacent selector.</p>
	</div>
