			<p>Songs From The West Coast, recorded by Elton John in 2001,
				signaled a return to form for the legendary pianist.</p>
			<p>After what I refer to as a four year hiatus of Elton pursuing
				Broadway and movie projects, he returned back to his roots and began
				a prolific run of great albums of what we fans have been craving for
				a long while: clean-sounding pop songs (such as I Want Love, which
				you can hear playing behind me) and brilliant lyrics by his longtime
				writer, Bernie Taupin.</p>
			<p>This album not only has some great tunes and wicked piano
				playing, but also beautiful lyrics. It signaled the beginning of
				Elton John's renaissance in the 2000's, which continues to this day.
				I highly recommend Songs From The West Coast, especially as the
				first of several amazing albums that Elton released in the next
				decade.</p>
