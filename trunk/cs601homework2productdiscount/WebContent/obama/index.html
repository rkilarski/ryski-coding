		<h1>Why You Should Vote For President Obama</h1>
		<h2>-Ryszard Kilarski</h2>
		<img src="obamabiden.jpg">
		<p>I have several friends who I’ve heard want to vote for Mr.
			Romney in the upcoming presidential election. I decided that I need
			to do my part in providing both positive reasons for President Obama
			and negative reasons against Mr. Romney in my own words in an attempt
			to persuade you to change your vote. So here I go.</p>

			<tr>
				<td><p>Because he restored our standing in the world after
						Bush screwed it all up. We got out of Iraq, we’re trying to get
						out of Afghanistan, we got Bin Laden, and we helped depose Gadhafi
						at a tiny fraction of the cost of Iraq and with no lives lost.</p>

					<p>Because he actually wants to pay for things and not put them
						on a credit card. Bush put two wars, Medicare D, and two huge tax
						cuts on a credit card while Obama gets pilloried for defining how
						the Affordable Care Act will be paid for. You may complain about
						the deficit and how it grew under Obama: Of course it grew! He a)
						put all those unpaid items on the official books and b) saved the
						US financial system from a monumental meltdown which required
						spending money to help stabilize the economy.</p>

					<p>Because Obama saved us from a freaking financial meltdown.
						Do you not remember where the DOW was four years ago because of
						Bush’s incompetence and republican deregulation? It was at around
						6,000. Today it is over 13,000. How’s that for growth? And jobs
						are growing. Slowly, but that beats the 700,000 job losses/month
						when he entered office.</p>

					<p>Because of the stimulus. Speaking of growth, I know that
						“stimulus” may be a dirty word with conservatives (and Obama
						capitulated to this mindset). However, did you notice that the
						economy has slowed down this year? Romney sure did, he keeps
						saying this year was slower than last year; last year was slower
						than the year before. This is true, and it’s because the (too
						small!) stimulus ran out and Congress has refused to pass a second
						stimulus along with any other economic help. Almost all economists
						were for a second one (or a significantly bigger first one), this
						would have definitely helped to recover the economy quicker if it
						had passed. So if you don’t like our current economy, blame
						Congressional Republican intransigence.</p>

					<p>Because Obama saved GM and the US auto industry. I also
						wouldn’t have done it; I would have let them go bankrupt. But he
						did it, and it worked. I was wrong.</p>

					<p>Because Obama passed the Affordable Care Act. It’s not
						perfect; I would have preferred a single payer system. But it’s
						definitely not a “socialist government takeover of healthcare”. It
						gets rid of preexisting conditions (including “being a woman”),
						helps kids stay on their parents’ insurance longer, and encourages
						personal responsibility by mandating that everyone sign up. That’s
						right, the “personal mandate”. Don’t tell me that you’re one of
						the Tea Partiers who are against personal responsibility of
						everyone to be “in the system” in order to pay for it.</p>

					<p>Because the economy needs levelheaded help.</p>

					<p>Because it is not class warfare to say that if you make
						millions of dollars, you should contribute a little more in taxes
						to help out those not as fortunate.</p>

					<p>Because Obama (finally!) endorsed the idea that a loving
						same-sex couple should have the same rights to marry as any other
						couple. Others have made many arguments for same-sex marriage that
						I won’t go to here. All I’ll say is this: if you don’t think this
						is such a big deal, or if you think “civil unions” are enough,
						then I’m disappointed you think marriage is such a cheap and
						unimportant thing. LGBT people certainly think higher of marriage
						than that and aspire to it.</p>

					<p>Because he got rid of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. It was a very
						harmful policy, and its repeal has been shown as a non-event. We
						were right.</p>

					<p>Because we need more Supreme Court Justices like Kennedy,
						Stevens, and Ginsburg, not Thomas, Scalia, and Alito.</p>

					<p>Because reality and history currently has a pro-Obama bias.
						Facts matter and facts back up Obama’s stands on much more than
						Romney.</p></td>
				<td>
					<p>Because he has fundamentally lied about his platform in the
						debates. Sure, Obama may exaggerate and omit to his advantage,
						that’s politics. But Romney previously embraced a far-right
						platform during the campaign and then cynically flipped in the
						debates to make himself seem more moderate.</p>

					<p>Because he said he would not have gone after Bin Laden.
						Remember him? The man who masterminded the murder of 3,000 people
						and caused untold damage to our economy, our standing in the
						world, and our sanity? The same man that Bush didn’t care about
						(instead obsessing over Saddam Hussein and Iraq—that went well!)
						and the same man Romney said he’d ignore.</p>

					<p>Because he wants to choke off Medicare and Social Security.
						Let’s be honest here, Republicans never liked these social
						programs. They call people on them “moochers” and “takers” and
						call this “big government”. You forget the astronomical poverty
						rate for Seniors before these two programs existed. You forget
						that we pay into these two programs all our working lives and that
						these are benefits, not giveaways.</p>

					<p>Because he and Republicans don’t care about the poor. The
						party that “embraces” Christianity but does the exact opposite of
						loving thy neighbor, turning the other cheek, and being their
						brother’s keeper should be offensive to anyone. I am an unabashed
						atheist; how is it I believe more in what Jesus actually taught
						than these people?</p>

					<p>Because Romney would have let Detroit go bankrupt—as I would
						have. But he was wrong and I was wrong. Obama’s plan worked.</p>

					<p>Because Romney and Ryan fought against equal rights for
						loving same-sex couples at every step. They were both against the
						repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, support the Defense of Marriage
						Act, and want to force their beliefs on everyone.</p>

					<p>Because they are against contraception. It’s 2012.</p>

					<p>Because they are against a woman’s right to choose. Abortion
						is not pretty, it’s not easy, and it’s not a good thing. But
						people deserve the respect and ability to choose for themselves.</p>

					<p>Because they are bought and paid for by the NRA. They are
						against sensible gun control. They are against closing the gun
						show loophole that doesn’t require background checks. They are
						against restricting automatic and semiautomatic guns. This is
						madness.</p>

					<p>Because we need more Supreme Court Justices like Kennedy,
						Stevens, and Ginsburg, not Thomas, Scalia, and Alito.</p>

					<p>Because "legitimate rape" should never be said.</p>

					<p>Because we were right about President Bush. We were
						brutally, painfully right. When he took his oath of office, we
						knew that we were going to war with Iraq (he so much as said so
						during the debates!). We knew when he was running the first time
						that he would be anti-gay, shower the rich with tax cuts, tank our
						economy, and waste our hard-earned surplus. We knew he'd try to
						voucherize Medicare and privatize Social Security, appoint
						hard-line conservatives to the Supreme Court, and ignore basic
						science and economics in key decisions. This is most assuredly not
						to rub it in or to crow "I told you so", but we should have some
						credibility with you after we all experienced with President Bush.
						So please try to listen to us when we say what we think about a
						President Romney; we've been paying attention.</p>
