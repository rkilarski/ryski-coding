        9. Write a one- or two-paragraph summary about the
        validation process that answers the following questions:
        Was the CSS validator easy to use? Did anything surprise
        you? Did you encounter a number of errors or just a few?
        How easy was it to determine how to correct the CSS file?
        Would you recommend the validator to other students? Why or
        why not?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Both the CSS and HTML validators are very easy to use.
          While neither offers any real surprises, one small issue
          I had with them is that the results page is a little
          busy. In my opinion, parts of the resulting page (after
          the check is run) look like advertising until you look
          closer at what is being presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only warning I received while using this tool is with
          validating HTML 5 code and that this is still marked as
          "experimental". I would definitely recommend the
          validator to other students because a) it's quite fast
          and easy to use, and b)is a good sanity check on the HTML
          and CSS you've written.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sanity check is especially important if you do not use
          an IDE or editor that uses syntax highlighting. I use
          Eclipse and other tools, so I can very easily see syntax
          errors and fix them before I ever need to validate; but
          if someone uses Notepad or some other simple text editor,
          then checking basic syntax through this tool is
          invaluable.
