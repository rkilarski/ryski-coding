 * Author: Ryszard Kilarski (Id: U81-39-8560) CS565 Homework #3.
 * 
 * Deitel "Java How To Program", page 1117: 26.11
 * This very brief problem statement points us to the example of section 26.8, which is shown in
 * Figures 26.18 and 26.19 which uses the technique of "bounded buffers". Then, it asks us to
 * re-implement that example using the "Lock and Condition Interfaces" technique of section 26.9.
 * This section already contains an example which uses "Lock and Condition Interfaces", which is
 * illustrated in Figures 26.20 and 26.21. However, this illustration does not contain the
 * "Consumer/Producer" example.
 *  
 * Our task is to substitute the "Lock and Condition Interfaces" technique into the program of
 * Figures 26.18 and 26.19 and to make the program execute properly.
 * 
 * Please study the sections 26.8 and 26.9. We have not covered these sections in class. However,
 * their primary purpose is to extend the concepts of the previous sections in Chapter 26 which use
 * the "Producer/Consumer" example to include two new Java resource-sharing techniques.
 * 
 * Also, please be aware that you do not have to typewrite the Java programs in sections 26.8 and
 * 26.9 into your computer. Those programs can be copied from the website
 * www.pearsonhighered.com/deitel/. When you get to the Deitel page, look for the illuminated
 * picture of the waterfall on the book cover in the upper left. Then, look at the menu on the
 * right of that book cover and click on "Code Examples". This will show you a selection of all of
 * the chapters in the book. Select Chapter 26, which is a zip file, then download it. The zip file
 * can be expanded into a folder which contains all of the examples of Chapter 26.
